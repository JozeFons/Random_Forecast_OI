# Random_Forecast_Order_Imbalace_example

This code will first calculate the bid and ask volumes, as well as the delta indicator, for each row in the DataFrame. It will then iterate through the rows and append a trade signal of 1 to the trade_signals list if the ratio of bid volume to ask volume exceeds the threshold and there is a positive delta, a trade signal of -1 if the ratio of ask volume to bid volume exceeds the threshold and there is a negative delta, and a trade signal of 0 otherwise.

# Note
Next, the code will split the data into features (bid_volume, ask_volume, and delta) and labels (trade_signals), and then split the data into training and testing sets. It will then initialize a random forest classifier and fit it to the training data. Finally, it will make predictions on the testing data and calculate the accuracy
